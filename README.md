# Case-Based-Reasoning-Fuzzy-Logic

The objective of this project was to explore the CBR pattern and fuzzy logic in an application for houses,
calculating the price of a house that the user inserts. We had a big data base containing several fields 
related to the house, for example, the year of construction, number of bedrooms, etc. And each one had 
some weight for the calculation.
